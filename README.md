# div-tool-duck-or-chicken

Motivation
The motivation of the duck or chicken divination came from the phrase "오리발 내밀지 마라"in Korea.
The pharse would literally mean "Don't stick out a duck’s foot"
As an idiom expression, it actually means to pretend to be innocent even after making a mistake.
When one refuses to take accountability for their own wrongdoing, and you’re sure this person is denying the truth, 
you can say to them “오리발 내밀지 마” (usually in an annoyed tone) which translates to “don’t lie to me”.

<h1>
What is it?
</h1>
I viewed the phrase in the point of view of Karma, a belief that the action in the past decides the fate in future. If you violate the law of conscience, the conscience will not let you go higher in acheivement or make you come back full circle of agony and pain.
In the website, the duck foot represents the wrongdoings. And chicken foot represents the consceintiouis act. 

People use this website to test their luck after they have done something about truth. If you lied or reject the truth, you click duck foot. If you told the truth or faced the truth directly, you choose chicken foot. After you click it, the divination tool will show foot of other animals that tells your luck of the day.

(duckfoot foretell)

The first random value choose between good and bad foretell. The duck foot has 60% of random value to
get a bad foretell and 40% of chance to get good foretell. And the chicken foot has 60% of chance to get good foretell while it has 40% of random value to get bad foretell. 

The second random value choose the actual animal foot foretell that is going to be shown from the list of a good or bad divination.

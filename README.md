# div-tool-duck-or-chicken
The motivation of the duck or chicken divination came from the phrase "오리발 내밀지 마라"in Korea.
The pharse would literally mean "Don't stick out a duck’s foot"
As an idiom expression, it actually means to pretend to be innocent even after making a mistake.
When one refuses to take accountability for their own wrongdoing, and you’re sure this person is denying the truth, 
you can say to them “오리발 내밀지 마” (usually in an annoyed tone) which translates to “don’t lie to me”.
